# About Me
## 20 Years of Tech, 0 Years of Being Bored.

They say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. Having spent over 20 years in the engineering trenches, I’ve hit that milestone a few times over, moving from the early days of "Java spaghetti" to the frontier of Agentic AI.

I’m currently a Director at FourKites, where I spend my days (and occasionally my dreams) building Digital Workforce AI Agents. Think of them as ultra-productive coworkers who never sleep, don't sneak on your lunch from the office fridge, and use frameworks like LangGraph to solve complex logistics flows.

    <p>When the agents are behaving themselves, you’ll usually find me deep in the data, playing archaeologist with engineering KPIs </p>

## My AI Philosophy: Infrastructure is the New King
While everyone else is chasing the "Model of the Week," I’m the one standing on a table shouting about Grounding, Guardrails, and Routing. I believe an LLM without a solid infrastructure is just a very eloquent hallucination engine. My mission is to turn those "stochastic parrots" into reliable workhorses that actually move the needle (and keep the CFO happy).

## My Leadership Blueprint
* **Scale with Soul:** Scaling platforms to **10,000+ MAUs** isn't just about code; it’s about culture. The focus is on fostering "A-Teams" that maintain engineering excellence without the burnout.
* **The Metric Mechanic:** fine tuning **DORA metrics** and engineering KPIs to ensure technical output is directly fueling business growth.
* **The Architectural Navigator:** The focus is on charting a course through complex technical trade-offs so that every architectural pivot is anchored in risk management and business opportunity.

Been on specialized diplomacy missions i.e. Building bridges between the dev-room and the board-room. This helps me ensure that technical decisions are always grounded in business impact !
